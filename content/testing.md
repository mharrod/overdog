## Introduction

At the end of a heavy season, we have found it incredibly useful to take our kids to a physiotherapist for a check-up. One of the primary advantages of visiting a physiotherapist, even in the absence of injuries, is the opportunity for a comprehensive assessment of their musculoskeletal system. 

Physiotherapists are highly skilled in analyzing your posture, movement patterns, and muscle imbalances. By evaluating your body's mechanics, they can identify potential areas of concern that may lead to future injuries or hinder their optimal performance.  They can then give you preventive exercises that you can incoporate into the off season training plan. 


## Full Testing Protocol


##### 3 Hop Test
The aim of this test is to perform three consecutive double-leg hops as far as possible. The athlete starts by standing behind a line with feet shoulder width apart. When ready, they are to perform three consecutive broad jumps non-stop, using a forward as well as a vertical jump style that allows them to gain maximum distance. They are able to use their arms assist the explosive movement and for balance.

* Metric: Total distance in meters
* Frequency: Weekly

  ##### 50m Sprint
The test involves running a single maximum sprint over a set distance, with time recorded. After a standardized warm up, the test is conducted over a certain distance, such as 10, 20, 40 and/or 50 meters or yards, depending on the sport and what you are trying to measure. The starting position should be standardized, starting from a stationary position with a foot behind the starting line, with no rocking movements

* Metric: Time in seconds
* Frequency: At the beginning. At the end of week three. At the end of week six

##### Astrand Treadmill Test
This is a running test performed on a treadmill. The treadmill speed is set to 5 miles/hr (8 km/hr). The subject runs at this speed for three minutes, at 0% grade. The gradient is then increased to 2.5% while maintaining the same speed. After every two minutes thereafter, the gradient is increased by 2.5% (keeping the same speed), until the athlete reaches exhaustion. When the athlete is unable to continue, the assistant stops the stopwatch and records the time.  This is a difficult test for younger athletes and they sometimes will quit due to boredom before they are physically spent.  We rarely use this test.

* Metric: Total time in minutes
* Frequency: Optional.  Usually done at the start and then again at the end

##### Illinois Agility Test
Participants should lie on their front (head to the start line) and hands by their shoulders. On the 'Go' command the stopwatch is started, and the athlete gets up as quickly as possible and runs forwards 10 meters to run around a cone, then back 10 meters, then runs up and back through a slalom course of four cones. Finally, the athlete runs another 10 meters up and back past the finishing cone, at which the timing is stopped   

* Metric: Total time in seconds
* Frequency: At the beginning. At the end of week three. At the end of week six

##### RSA 20m
7 sprints over a distance of 20m. Sprint times were recorded using a timing gate. A 10s passive recovery period between each run        

* Metric: (Total Time â€“ (Best time x 5)) / Total Time x 100
* Frequency: Weekly
* Guidance: https://www.topendsports.com/testing/tests/sprint-repeat.htm

##### Vertical Jump                

the athlete stands side on to a wall and reaches up with the hand closest to the wall. Keeping the feet flat on the ground, the point of the fingertips is marked or recorded. This is called the standing reach height. The athlete then stands away from the wall, and leaps vertically as high as possible using both arms and legs to assist in projecting the body upward (countermovement e.g. arm swing allowed. No step allowed)  

* Metric: Total height in centimeters and peak power using Harman formula and average power using Harman formula 
* Frequency: Weekly
* Guidance: https://www.topendsports.com/testing/tests/vertjump.htm

##### Weight/body Fat Composition
Measure both weight and fat using body fat scale.  We do not share these measurements with the kids.  We primarily collect this information to better assess improvements in other tests such as vertical jumps.  

* Metric: Kg and percent
* Frequency: Weekly
