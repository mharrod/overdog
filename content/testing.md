* Vertical Jump and RSA 10M were done weekly
* All test were done at the beginning of the 6 weeks and then repeated at the end
* We don't often do the Astrand Treadmill test as it can get boring for our younger kids 
* For vertical measurements we prefer a metric that is not totally reliant on heigh but rather takes body weight into considration.

**make time for physio**

At the end of a heavy season, we found it incredibly useful to take our kids to a physiotherapist for a check-up. One of the primary advantages of visiting a physiotherapist, even in the absence of injuries, is the opportunity for a comprehensive assessment of your musculoskeletal system. Physiotherapists are highly skilled in analyzing your posture, movement patterns, and muscle imbalances. By evaluating your body's mechanics, they can identify potential areas of concern that may lead to future injuries or hinder your optimal performance.  They can then give you preventive exercises that you can incoporate into your off season training plan.
