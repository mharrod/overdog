We were parents looking for an off-season conditioning program for our kids that would fit their busy schedules and provide a heavy focus on mobility and pre-hab training.

After looking at all our options and the associated costs, we decided that the only way forward was to devise a program based on our own experiences as competitive athletes combined with rigorous research and helpful insights from a wide array of coaches and fitness professionals. 

This website implements our learnings for an off-season soccer conditioning program for the young novice athlete (U13/U14). Please feel free to use adapt and share as much as possible.  We have tried to credit the original sources wherever possible.

**Disclaimer: As with all fitness programs, it is best to check with your medical provider and coaches that the program suits your kids.  Also, if your kids have limited weight-lifting experience, it is a good idea to seek a professional to teach them to lift correctly.**
