Initially, we struggled with including testing as part of the training program.  We thought it might put too much pressure on our kids.  Moreover, we worried that our kids would fixate on improving their testing numbers rather than their overall performance.

Here is a summary of our core testing protocol:

| Test Name  | Metrics  |
|---|---|
| 3 Hop Test  | Total distance in meters |
| Vertical Jump | Vertical jump power calculation (Harman)  |
| RSA 10m  | (Total Time – (Best time x 5)) / Total Time x 100 |
| Illinois Agility Test  | Time in seconds  |
| Weight | Weight in KG |
| Body Fat | Percentage |

In the end, our fears around testing proved to be unwarranted. Our kids found testing motivational and it fostered a sense of accomplishment.  As parents, it helped us better identify areas of improvement and customize exercises in the program as needed. Overall a win-win approach.
